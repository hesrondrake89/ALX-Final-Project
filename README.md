## Inspiration

I was inspired to create this project by my passion for movies and series. I wanted to build a tool that simplifies the process of finding information about these titles.

## Technical Challenge

One of the technical challenges I faced was integrating the OMDB API into the application and structuring the fetched data to display it in a user-friendly manner.

## Struggles

I encountered several issues during the development, including styling issues, positioning errors, and implementing error handling. One notable challenge was correctly positioning error messages on the search page. It kept displaying beneath the footer. I had to use CSS code to rightly position that error message. Another notable challenge was the integration of the APIs to fetch upcoming movie releases and display movie information. The UI also gave me some BIG challenges.

## Next Iteration

In the next iteration, I plan to add more features, such as movie suggestions when a user tries to search for a movie via the input bar, it suggests other titles with similar name. I also plan to to introduce â€œin theater and trending movie/series sections just like I did with the upcoming movie releases. Will try to add movie recommendations as well. Finally. I also aim to enhance the overall user interface for a more polished look.
